# Modeling Carbon Flux in Aquatic Ecosystems

## 🌊 Research Overview
This project investigates **lateral carbon transport** between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It combines **field data from freshwater lakes** with **computational modeling** to improve predictions of carbon flux.

## 🔬 Early Research in Dr. Stuart Jones’s Lab  
In my **sophomore year** at the University of Notre Dame, I joined **Dr. Stuart Jones’s lab**, working on the **limnology team**.  
- Conducted **aquatic water sampling** in the lab.  
- Measured **nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon content** in lake water.  
- Developed fundamental skills in **ecological monitoring and analysis**.

## 🌿 Summer Fieldwork at UNDERC (2021)  
During the **summer of 2021**, I worked at the **University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center (UNDERC)** in **northern Wisconsin**, a **NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) site**.  
- **Field Sampling:** Collected **temperature, light, color, and carbon content** data from **12+ lakes**.  
- **Lab Analysis:** Processed samples, filtered water, and analyzed carbon content.  
- **Long-term Monitoring:** Contributed to an ongoing **limnology dataset**.  

💡 **Impact:** This immersive field experience **sparked my passion for research** and led me to consider **graduate school**.

## 📊 Modeling Carbon Transport with Dr. Ceara Talbot  
After the summer at UNDERC, I collaborated with **Dr. Ceara Talbot** (then a graduate student in the Jones lab, now at Carnegie Science Institute) to work on:  
- A **dual-process terrestrial-aquatic carbon transport model**.  
- Investigating **sensitive terrestrial parameters** affecting lateral carbon movement.  
- Analyzing **water use efficiency changes in response to drought**.  
- Implementing **dynamic water use efficiency data** into the **lateral carbon transport model**.  

💡 **Goal:** To **improve predictions** of carbon transport across land and water.

## 🎤 Presenting at AGU 2022  
In **December 2022**, I presented this research at the **American Geophysical Union (AGU) Conference**:  
- Shared findings on **drought-driven water use efficiency changes**.  
- Explored how **terrestrial dynamics influence lake carbon flux**.  
- Engaged with experts in **ecology, hydrology, and climate modeling**.
