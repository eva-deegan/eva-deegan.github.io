# Fire Ecology in National Parks

## Research Overview  
This project focused on **modernizing fire effects data analysis** for the **National Park Service (NPS)** by developing R-based **quality control** and **data analysis workflows**. It also contributed to **community building in NPS fire ecology** through mentorship, presentations, and collaboration.

---

## Moving to Tucson & Transition to Fire Ecology  
After graduating from Notre Dame, I started a **Scientist in Parks** internship as a **Fire Ecology Assistant** in **Tucson, Arizona**.   
- **A major shift from the Midwest**‚Äîthis was my first experience living in the desert.  
- **Excited to explore desert ecology and fire science** through a **year-long internship**.  

---

## The 20+ Year Fire Effects Dataset Challenge  
The **fire ecology program** in Southern Arizona maintained a **20+ year fire effects dataset**, passed between many different fire ecologists.  
- **Problems:**  
  - Data had **errors, inconsistencies, and gaps**.  
  - No **standardized quality control (QA/QC)** or workflow for analysis.  
- **Solution:** I independently proposed creating an **R package** to systematically check and analyze the data.

---

## Developing R Packages for Fire Data  
I created **two R packages** to **streamline fire data quality control and analysis**:  
 **[FFI QAQC](https://github.com/gldejong/FFIqaqc)** ‚Üí A package to **detect data issues** in fire effects monitoring.  
 **[FFI Analysis](https://github.com/gldejong/FFIanalysis)** ‚Üí A package for **automated fire data analysis and reporting**.

 **Key Contributions**:  
- Designed a **reproducible workflow** for fire data quality control.  
- Created **automated reports** for **NPS fire managers** to use in decision-making.  
- Improved **data transparency and efficiency** within the fire program.  

---

## Final Analysis Report on the 2002 Fire  
As part of this project, I produced a **final analysis report** on a **2002 fire**, conducting:  
- **Data analyses** on long-term fire effects  
- **Management recommendations** based on fire severity trends  
- A discussion with fire managers about **future fire mitigation strategies**  

üí° **Impact:** This report sparked an in-depth discussion among NPS fire managers about refining **long-term fire monitoring strategies**.

---

## Founding the NPS Fire Ecology R Working Group  
Recognizing the **lack of structured R support**, I helped establish the **NPS Fire Ecology R Working Group**:  
- **A national community** of fire ecologists discussing R-based workflows.  
- **Monthly meetings** to discuss **coding challenges, best practices, and data analysis**.  
- This **group still meets today**, supporting NPS-wide fire data analysis!  

---

## Nationwide Presentations & Policy Impact  
I presented my work to:  
‚úî **NPS Inventory & Monitoring Data Managers** ‚Äì Highlighting the impact of fire ecology QA/QC.  
‚úî **National Park Service Fire Ecologists (Nationwide Call)** ‚Äì Led a discussion on **modernizing fire data analysis**.  
‚úî **Committee for FFI Database Improvements** ‚Äì Ongoing involvement in **enhancing fire data quality**.  

 **Key Takeaway:** This project didn‚Äôt just improve **one dataset**‚Äîit started a **system-wide shift** toward better fire data management in **NPS Fire Ecology**.

## 2024 NPS Regional Fire Management Achievement Award  
For my contributions to **fire data modernization, software development, and community leadership**, I was honored to receive the **2024 NPS Regions 6,7,8 Fire Management Achievement Award**.

---

## Fieldwork & Personal Growth  
Alongside data analysis, I participated in **fire effects field trips** with the **Inventory & Monitoring Network**, collecting real-world data on:  
- **Vegetation recovery after fire**  
- **Fuel loads and fire severity**  
- **Long-term ecological changes**  

 **My time at the Desert Research Learning Center (DRLC) and in Tucson was transformational.**  
- **Gained a lifelong passion** for fire ecology.  
- **Committed to educating others about fire science**.  
- **Continue to stay involved with NPS Fire Ecology** to this day.
